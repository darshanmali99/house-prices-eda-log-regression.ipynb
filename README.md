# 🏠 House Prices – Data Analysis & Regression

This project is an end-to-end data analysis and baseline regression modeling exercise using the **Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset.

## 🎯 Objective
To understand the factors influencing house prices and build a clean, interpretable baseline regression model.

## 📊 What This Project Covers

- Problem understanding (regression mindset)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (numeric vs categorical features)
- Target variable distribution analysis
- Structured missing value handling:
  - Structural missing values (`None`)
  - Numeric median imputation
  - Categorical mode imputation
- Encoding strategy:
  - Ordinal encoding for quality-based features
  - One-hot encoding for nominal features
- Baseline Linear Regression model
- First Kaggle submission and leaderboard ranking

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Missing data does not always mean "unknown" — it can encode real information
- Encoding strategy has a strong impact on model performance
- RMSE is sensitive to target distribution and outliers
- Building a strong baseline is more important than jumping to complex models

## 📈 Results

- Baseline Linear Regression RMSE: ~73,000
- Kaggle Leaderboard Rank: **5541**

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Log transformation of target variable
- Regularization (Ridge / Lasso)
- Performance improvement and comparison
